Processing-based time visualization

LIVE SIMULATION: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/637721#

 Ambient visualization of absolute time in a creative way. The 60 bouncing balls are the current seconds, every second one ball disappears and starts over when the minute is full. The grey layer visualizes the current minutes, rising continuously until the full hour. The polygon wheel is the current hour, visualizing with its edges the passed hours of the day in the 24h format. 03:00 is a triangle, 08:00 an octagon and 19:00 an enneadecagon. The background color is the current day of the year, fading from Jan to Dec through the Hue-Colorspace. See code for more Info.
Press any key to display the current time // Bouncy Balls = Seconds // Rising screen = Minutes // Polygon edges = Hours // Color = Day of the year.
